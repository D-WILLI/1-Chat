# 1 Chat
Is an invitation only based messenger app that currently allows users to chat with invited friends, and friend of friends only.

# User Story
As developers we created a real-world full-stack application that incorporated React, graphQl, Node.js, Socket IO, and Express.js to create a RESTful API. We utilized GraphQl and Appollo for the database. This application at minimum allow the user to:

* Sign Up
* Login
* Search Friends
* Populate a friend list

## Installation

GIVEN a Chat application
WHEN I open the Home Page
THEN I am presented with a link to a login/register
Then I enter my email, username, and password on the form 
THEN I am presented with a page with empty fields to enter my own information to create/post my profile  
THEN the profile I have entered is saved and appears in the main chat page
WHEN I click on the Search friends  in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with a list of friends. 
When I click on a friend, I am able to start a conversation. 
In the future, WHEN I click on the friend, I am the conversation will actually open. 

This application authenticates with B-Script and the new technology that is used was to import jquery to access the date to then utilize the timestamp feature which was a process and new to us.

In this project, we learned a lot -- more specifically -- about queries  revolvers,  mutations, JavaScript and typeDefs, as well and selecting specific data points from the APIs to "inject" them into while connecting the front end vs. backend.
